# Poker-Card-Game-SwiftUI
In this project, I developed a captivating poker card game app using Swift UI, showcasing my skills in iOS app development. The app offers an immersive gaming experience, allowing users to test their luck and strategic thinking.

Utilizing Swift UI, I designed an intuitive interface that displays two random cards on the screen. Players can tap on a button to generate a new card, each with a random number. The game incorporates a scoring mechanism where if one card has a higher value than the other, the player's scores increase, adding an element of excitement and competition.

Throughout the development process, I focused on creating a seamless user experience, ensuring smooth transitions and visually appealing card designs. I implemented the necessary logic to handle card generation, randomization, and score tracking.

By crafting this poker card game app, I demonstrated my proficiency in Swift UI, UI design, and game logic implementation. This project highlights my ability to create engaging and interactive mobile applications while paying attention to user experience and visual aesthetics.

Overall, this poker card game app serves as a testament to my technical skills, creativity, and passion for mobile app development.
